# React Temperatures

A small exercise to try out state propagation in React. Based on https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html

## Getting started

- Run `make` for a list of options.

- Run `make img` to build your own docker image.

- Run `make dev` to start developing your site. Your site's files will live in the `./site` directory
